ABSTRACT:
  The primary purpose of this program, ironically referred to as dedit, will be to use as a command-line file explorer
  with extra functionality to edit and organized the superstructure of files
  
  
  RANDOM IDEAS:
  
    - Sort Directories by file-name or file-type. 
    - copy contents of entire library into a new sorted one.
        ~ use File-tree to do this quickly sorting
        ~ 
        - Sort according to file type: 1st layer is file type (text, image, sound, video, executables, misc, ,etc.)    
                                       2nd layer is the specific format ( .txt, .png, .mp3, .mp4, .class, .exe, , etc.)
                                       3rd layer are the files themselves. 
                                       4th layer (optional) is user-specified according to file name, a seperate directory will be created for each string provided by the user. 
        
   - Have Folder and textfile objects that extend File object, ie. are child classes of the File object and inherit functionality from it.
